\item In each of the following cases, let $T$ be the linear operator on $R^2$ which is represented by matrix $A$ in the standard ordered basis for $R^2$, and let $U$ be the linear operator on $C^2$ represented by $A$ in the standard ordered basis. Find the characteristic polynomial for $T$ and that for $U$, find the characteristic value of each operator, and for each characteristic value $c$ find a basis for the corresponding space of characteristic vectors.
\begin{align}
    \vec{A_1} &= \myvec{1&0\\
                     0&0}\\
    \vec{A_2} &= \myvec{2&3\\
                     -1&1}\\
    \vec{A_3} &= \myvec{1&1\\
                     1&1}
