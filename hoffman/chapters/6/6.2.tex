\item Let T be the linear operator on $\vec{R}^3$ which is represented in the standard ordered basis by the matrix
\begin{align}
\myvec{-9&4&4\\-8&3&4\\-16&8&7}
\label{eq:solutions/6/2/4/Q}
\end{align}
Prove that T is diagonalizable by exhibiting a basis for $\vec{R}^3$, each vector of which is a characteristic vector of T.
