\item Find a row-reduced matrix which is row equivalent to,
\begin{align}
\vec{A} = \myvec{i&-(1+i)&0\\1&-2&1\\1&2i&-1}

\item Let
\begin{align}
    \vec{A}=\myvec{a & b\\c & d}
\end{align}
be a $2\times2$ matrix with complex entries. Suppose A is row-reduced and also that $a+b+c+d=0$. Prove that there are exactly three such matrices.
