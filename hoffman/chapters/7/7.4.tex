\item Construct a linear operator $T$ with minimal polynomial $x^2(x-1)^2$ and characteristic polynomial $x^3(x-1)^4$.Describe the primary decomposition of the vector space under $T$ and find the projections on the primary components.Find a basis in which the matrix $T$ is in Jordan form.Also find an explicit direct sum decomposition of the space into $T$cyclic subspaces as in theorem 3 and give the invariant factors.
