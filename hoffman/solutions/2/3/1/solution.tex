Assume $v$ and $w$ are the two vectors which belongs to $V$ and $F$ be field. 

If $v$ and $w$ are linearly dependent, then there exists $a_1$ and $a_2$ which belongs to field $F$ such that
\begin{align}\label{eq:solutions/2/3/1/eq_1}
    a_1v + a_2w &= 0; a_1 \ne 0
\end{align}
Now solve the \eqref{eq:solutions/2/3/1/eq_1} to get the value of vector $v$;
\begin{align}
    v &= -\frac{a_2w}{a_1} \\
    v &= cw\label{eq:solutions/2/3/1/eq_2} \\
    \implies c &= -\frac{a_2}{a_1}
\end{align}
Thus, \eqref{eq:solutions/2/3/1/eq_2} indicates that if two vectors $v$ and $w$ are linearly dependent, one of them $v$ is a scalar multiple of the other $w$.
