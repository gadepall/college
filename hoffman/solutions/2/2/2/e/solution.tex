If V is a vector Space over field F. A subspace of V is a subset W of V which is itself a vector space over F with the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication on V








Let $f$ and $g$ be any continuous functions from  $ R\rightarrow R$   



and let $c$ be any scalar
 $\in R$

From real analysis we know that sum and product of continuous functions is continuous. So $cf+g$ is also a continuous function. 

Proof:
$f$ and $g$ are continuous at a, condition for continuity will be satisfied
\begin{equation}
    \lim_{x \to a} f(x)=k_1
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\lim_{x \to a} g(x)=k_2    
\end{equation}
Applying limits to $cf+g$
\begin{align}
\lim_{x \to a} cf(x)+g(x)=\lim_{x \to a} g(x)+\lim_{x \to a} f(x)=k_1+k_2
\end{align}

So $cf+g$ is also continuous at a
We know from theorem that any non-empty subset $W$ of $V$ is a subspace of $V$ if and only if for each pair of vectors $\alpha$, $\beta$ in W and each scalar $c$ in $F$ the vector $c\alpha+\beta$ is again in $W$. 
So given vector space is a subspace.
