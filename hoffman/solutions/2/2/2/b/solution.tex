 A non-empty subset $\vec{W}$ of $\vec{V}$ is a subspace of $\vec{V}$ if and only if for each pair of vectors ${\alpha}$ ${\beta}$ in $\vec{W}$ and each scalar  $c$ in $\vec{R}$ the vector ${{c\alpha}+{\beta}}$ is again in  $\vec{W}$.
For each of the function to be a subspace, it must be closed with respect to addition and scalar multiplication in $\vec{V}$ defined as, for $f$ $g$ $\epsilon$ $\vec{W}$ and $c$ $\epsilon$ $R$
\\ \\ 
Then,
    \begin{align}
    h&=cf+g\\
    h(0)&=cf(0)+g(0)\\
    &=cf(1)+g(1)\\
    &=h(1)
    \end{align}
                  Thus, $h(0)=h(1)$. Therefore,$\vec{W}$ is a subset of $\vec{V}$ and also a vector space. Therefore $\vec{W}$ is a subspace of $\vec{V}$.\\
    Hence, $f(0) = f(1)$ is a subspace of $\vec{V}$.
