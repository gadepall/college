For each of the function to be a subspace, it must be closed with respect to addition and scalar multiplication in $\vec{V}$ defined as, for $f$ $g$ $\epsilon$ $\vec{W}$\\
Then,
\begin{align}
(f+g)(x^2)&=f(x^2)+g(x^2)\\
&=f(x)^2+ g(x)^2\\
&\ne(f+g)(x)^2
\end{align}
Since $\vec{W}$ is not closed with respect to addition. So It is not a subspace of $\vec{V}$.
