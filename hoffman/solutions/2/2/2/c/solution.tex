For each of the function to be a subspace, it must be closed with respect to addition and scalar multiplication in $\vec{V}$ defined as, for $f$ $g$ $\epsilon$ $\vec{W}$\\
Then,
\begin{align}
(f+g)(3)&=f(3)+g(3)\\
&=1+f(-5)+1+g(-5)\\
&=2+f(-5)+g(-5)\\
&=2+(f+g)(-5)\\
&\ne1+(f+g)(-5)
\end{align}
Since $\vec{W}$ is not closed with respect to addition $\therefore$ It is not a subspace of $\vec{V}$.
