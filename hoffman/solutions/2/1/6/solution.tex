  To prove that $\mathbb{V}$ with the given operations is a vector space over the field of real numbers, we have to start by proving that additivity and homogeneity both hold true.
 So, we have to prove that (cf+g)(t) is equal to cf(t)+g(t).
 \begin{align}
 (cf+g)(t)\\
 =(cf)(t)+g(t)\\
 =cf(t)+g(t)
 \end{align}
 Now, we know that f(-t)= $\overline{f(-t)}$ and so (cf+g)(t) should also satisfy the property,
 \begin{align}
 (cf+g)(-t)\\
 =cf(-t)+g(-t)\\
 =c\overline{f(t)}+\overline{g(t)}\\
 =\overline{cf(t)+g(t)}\\
 =\overline{(cf+g)(t)}
 \end{align}
 {\textbf{Example}}
 Let's take f(x)=a+ix
 \begin{align}
 f(1)=a+i
 \end{align}
 Hence, f(x) is not real valued.Now,
 \begin{align}
 f(x)=a+ix\\
 f(-x)=a-ix\\
 f(-x)=\overline{f(x)}
 \end{align}
 Since a and x $\in$ $\mathbb{R}$, so f $\in$ $\mathbb{V}$
