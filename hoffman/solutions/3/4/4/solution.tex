Here $T$ is a linear operator on $V$ and $B$ is an ordered basis of $V$.
Let us consider $[T]_B = A$, so $A = \myvec{a & b\\c & d}$.

Now, the characteristic equation of $A$ is:
\begin{align}
\mydet{A-\lambda I}=0\\
\implies \mydet{a-\lambda & b\\c & d-\lambda}=0\\
\implies \lambda^2 - (a+d)\lambda + (ad-bc)=0
\end{align}
According to the Cayley-Hamilton's Theorem, every square matrix satisfies its own characteristic equation. Here $A$ is a 2x2 square matrix, so it should also satisfy its characteristic equation.

Now,
\begin{align}
\lambda^2 - (a+d)\lambda + (ad-bc)=0\\
\implies A^2 - (a+d)A + (ad-bc)I=0
\label{eq:solutions/3/4/4/eqn:1}
\end{align}

We can also write the equation \ref{eq:solutions/3/4/4/eqn:1} as:
\begin{align}
[T]_B^2 - (a+d)[T]_B + (ad-bc)I=0\\
\text{or, } T^2 - (a+d)T + (ad-bc)I=0
\end{align}
